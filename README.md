# Defect-Band-Visualization
This repository includes python codes to plot defect bands across the band gap for DFT and Hybrid functionals.

This respository includes examples of input scrips as well as python codes that can be run on spyder or other ide. The codes can also be run directly in the terminal if a python/anaconda module is loaded.
